<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p><em>The chief beauty of this book lies not so much in its literary style</em>, <em>or in the extent and usefulness of the information it conveys</em>, <em>as in its simple truthfulness</em>. <em>Its pages form the record of events that really happened</em>. <em>All that has been done is to colour them</em>; <em>and</em>, <em>for this</em>, <em>no extra charge has been made</em>. <em>George and Harris and Montmorency are not poetic ideals</em>, <em>but things of flesh and bloodâ€”especially George</em>, <em>who weighs about twelve stone</em>. <em>Other works may excel this in depth of thought and knowledge of human nature: other books may rival it in originality and size</em>; <em>but</em>, <em>for hopeless and incurable veracity</em>, <em>nothing yet discovered can surpass it</em>. <em>This</em>, <em>more than all its other charms</em>, <em>will</em>, <em>it is felt</em>, <em>make the volume precious in the eye of the earnest reader</em>; <em>and will lend additional weight to the lesson that the story teaches</em>.</p>
<p>LONDON, <em>August</em>, 1889.</p>
